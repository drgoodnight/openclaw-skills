# Historical Analogs

Known influence operation patterns for scoring NARCS.R (Repeat Historical Analog). When analysing a narrative, compare its structure against these templates.

## Pattern: The Safety Pivot

**Structure:** Genuine safety concern → expanded definition of "safety" → safety used to justify control.
**Emotional arc:** Fear → moral obligation → compliance as virtue.
**Examples:** Post-9/11 surveillance expansion, online "safety" bills expanding to censorship.
**Signature:** The word "safety" appears in legislation titles. Questioning the measure = "putting people at risk."

## Pattern: The Manufactured Consensus

**Structure:** Study/report released → media amplifies simultaneously → experts validate → policy follows within weeks.
**Emotional arc:** Concern → certainty → urgency → action.
**Signature:** Speed of consensus formation. Genuine consensus takes years; manufactured takes days.

## Pattern: The Villain Simplification

**Structure:** Complex systemic problem → blame assigned to specific group → group dehumanised → action against group normalised.
**Emotional arc:** Confusion → anger → moral clarity → permission.
**Signature:** The proposed solution only targets the villain, not the system. The problem persists after the villain is dealt with.

## Pattern: The Overton Shift

**Structure:** Extreme position floated → public rejects → "moderate" position offered → moderate position is what was wanted all along.
**Emotional arc:** Shock → relief → acceptance.
**Signature:** The "compromise" was the goal. The extreme was the anchor.

## Pattern: The Crisis Ratchet

**Structure:** Crisis occurs → emergency powers activated → crisis subsides → powers remain.
**Emotional arc:** Panic → gratitude → normalisation → forgetting.
**Signature:** Temporary measures become permanent. Questioning them = "wanting the crisis back."

## Pattern: The Tribal Split

**Structure:** Issue introduced → sides form → each side demonises the other → nuance becomes betrayal.
**Emotional arc:** Curiosity → opinion → identity → warfare.
**Signature:** "You're either with us or against us." Middle ground collapses. The issue itself becomes secondary to tribal membership.

## Pattern: The Memory Wash

**Structure:** Event occurs → initial reporting → narrative shifts → original facts become "misinformation."
**Emotional arc:** Awareness → confusion → doubt → acceptance of new version.
**Signature:** Fact-checkers correct the original accurate reporting. "That's been debunked" applied to things that happened.

## Pattern: The Preemptive Frame

**Structure:** Narrative established → event occurs → event interpreted through pre-established frame → alternative interpretations = conspiracy.
**Emotional arc:** Primed expectation → confirmation → certainty.
**Signature:** Public "already knows" what happened before investigation. Investigation confirms the pre-frame. Dissent is pre-labelled.

## Pattern: The Compassion Trap

**Structure:** Vulnerable group highlighted → policy proposed "for their protection" → policy grants power to protectors → protected group has less autonomy.
**Emotional arc:** Empathy → moral duty → compliance → inability to question without appearing cruel.
**Signature:** Criticising the policy = "attacking the vulnerable." The vulnerable group wasn't consulted.

## Scoring Guide

When comparing a current narrative to these patterns:

- **0–2:** No structural resemblance to known patterns.
- **3–4:** Surface similarities but different emotional arc or timeline.
- **5–6:** Clear structural match to one pattern, some deviation in execution.
- **7–8:** Strong match to one or more patterns, emotional arc aligns, timeline compressed.
- **9–10:** Near-exact replay of known pattern, multiple structural matches, deviation from template minimal.
